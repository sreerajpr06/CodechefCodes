/*
Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier â€” a machine which mutates minions.

Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.

Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.

Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

---------------------------------------------
Input Format:

The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.

The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.

The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.

---------------------------------------------
Output Format:

For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.
